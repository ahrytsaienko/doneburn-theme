# doneburn-emacs

This is a dark on light Emacs theme based on [Bozhidar Batsov's Zenburn
theme](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs).

Chris Done created [the original theme](https://github.com/chrisdone/zenburn).
This is an updated version for modern Emacsen.

## Note

This theme is still a work in progress, mainly useful for my own daily usage for
now. It lacks support for popular packages (e.g. Helm) simply because I just
added the faces for the packages I use.

PRs are more than welcome.
